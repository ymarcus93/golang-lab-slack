# Golang Boston Lab #3 - Building a Slack bot Testing One more test

Welcome to Boston Golang Lab #3 - Building a Slack bot

Format of this meetup:

1. (10-15 minute) introduction to building bots in Slack

1. (60 minutes) Choose your own adventure:
   - Go through the example `weatherbot` exercise
     
     *or* 

   - Build your own slack bot (form teams of 2 or more!)

1. (15 minutes) Battle of the bots! Show off what you've done

## Prerequisites 

1. PLEASE BRING:  A laptop with a Go language environment with Go 1.6 already set up. Please see 'Vagrant setup' below to get started with one easily.
  * If you are having trouble setting up your Go programming environment, please join the #lab-help channel in the Boston Golang Slack group. You can signup for the Slack group [here](http://bostongolang-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/).

2. PLEASE BRING: A text editor or IDE suitable for writing Go code.
  * For beginners, [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com) is a good option. Make sure you install the Go plugin [here](https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime).
  * For VIM users, there is a pretty nice VIM setup [here](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go).  
  * If you'd like, you can also use the Vagant setup which has a Go environment set up (See [VAGRANT_SETUP.md](VAGRANT_SETUP.md)).

3. PLEASE HAVE:  Some basic Go language exposure.  You should be familiar with the Go basics: e.g., Go's types, structs, control flow structures, goroutines, and channels.   
Other programming language experience and concepts (such as networking, etc) will be helpful. A good introduction to the basics of Go for people familiar with 
other programming language is available at: [https://tour.golang.org](https://tour.golang.org). If you can get through this tour, you will be well-prepared for this meetup!

## Labs 

### For beginners: weatherbot 

Weatherbot responds to requests for the weather.

Build a Slack bot that responds to `weather <zip code|name of place>` and return the weather for the zip code.

### For advanced: build your own!

Ideas:

  * untableflip: resets a 'tableflip' emoji
  * TBD
